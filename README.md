## Investigate TMDb Movie Database
The goal of this project is to conduct my own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. 
I started by taking a look at my movie dataset from The Movie Database (TMDb) and brainstormed what questions I could answer 
using it. Then I used pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I was most interested in, and created a report sharing the answers.

This project is a part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

## What do I need to install? 
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- csv

I recommend to install Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.

## Why this Project?
In this project, I had to go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. 
I also used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!

## What did I learn?

After completing the project, I have learned following :
- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
